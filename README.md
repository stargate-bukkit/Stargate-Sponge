## Description
Stargate-Bukkit is the original MineCraft portal plugin; it existed for as long as MineCraft server modding has been feasible!

## History
Originally conceived and written by Dinnerbone, this project is now maintained by [several individual developers](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Sponge/graphs/contributors).<br>
Notable contributions to the Sponge ecosystem have been made by this project's upstream developers, theDgtl and pie-flavor.

In 2022 [Stargate-Rewritten](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Bukkit), by Thorinwasher and EpicKnarvik97, is slated to be ported to the sponge ecosystem.
When that port is available, this repository will be used to host it.
